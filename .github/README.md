## Important!
I am very soon planning on redoing my Linux install, so there might not be any pushes to this repository for a bit.

## Programs of Chocie
- window manager - jwm
- terminal - alacritty
- music player - mpd with ncmpcpp
- web browser - qutebrowser
- editor - nvim
    - *note:* configuration for nvim is located in `.config/nvim-custom`. For it to be used in nvim, a symbolic link is needed: `ln -s ../../nvim-custom/ ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom`
- file manager - ranger

### Configs Yet to be Added
- fonts - trigon & terminus
